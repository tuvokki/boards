# My Boards repo
This holds all my experiments on ESP32 and ESP8266 boards of which I have several including Devkit v1, Arduino and several sensors and displays.

Once this will all amalgamate into something useful. Right now I jump from joy when a pixel chages luminance on my oled display or a led on my breadboard is flashing.

Robots, I'm with you...
